‘CCHMC Schedules’ is a web application designed and developed for maintaining the morning visit schedules of the doctor’s team. The application will help everyone on duty to have a real-time update for ongoing schedule. Application will allow the administrative user to complete the following functions:

•	Create a new schedule and allocate times to the schedule associated with specific room

•	Edit the schedule if the time, duration etc. changes

•	Remove a schedule which is no longer required. For instance, if a patient is discharged and that room is no longer occupied the schedule associated will also be removed

•	Change the priority of a schedule to move it up or down in the schedule list

The application automatically picks up the previous day’s schedule to current day and changes can be made if required. 

To setup this application, please refer the setup document.
